# Gaps Analysis: New Steps Project Development Plan

After comparing the original project description with the development plan, I've identified the following gaps or areas that need more specific attention:

## 1. Donation Logistics Details

**Project Description Specifics:**
- For donors in the San Francisco Bay Area, there's a specific process: they can either ship shoes or have them picked up by an operator from their home/school/sports facility
- For donors outside the Bay Area, shipping is the only option

**Gap in Development Plan:** 
- The plan doesn't specifically address the regional differences in donation handling (Bay Area vs. elsewhere)
- The pick-up service for Bay Area donors isn't explicitly included in the development plan
- Need to add geolocation detection or address validation to identify Bay Area donors

## 2. Financial Transaction Management

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Money donations are specifically made by check, payable to "New Steps Project"
- Shipping fee payment mechanism is mentioned but not detailed

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- The development plan mentions a "Money donation interface" but doesn't specify the check-based system
- Need to clarify how shipping fees will be processed (payment gateway integration)
- Tracking of received checks and payment reconciliation process is not detailed

## 3. Shoe Details Presentation

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Shoe details page should have up to 4 photo snapshots with thumbnails and full-size view options
- Each shoe should have a unique ID and URL
- Shoe IDs should be used to generate order IDs

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- The photo management system needs more detail (4 photos per shoe with thumbnails)
- The ID and URL generation system for shoes isn't specifically addressed
- Order ID generation based on shoe IDs isn't mentioned

## 4. Order Status Workflow

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Very specific order statuses: pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled, requested return, and return received

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- While order status management is mentioned, the specific statuses aren't detailed
- The return processing workflow isn't clearly defined
- Need to include a returns management system in the admin dashboard

## 5. Admin Dashboard Specific Features

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Inventory counts shown in badges
- Detailed shoe search criteria (sport name, brand name, description, size, color, etc.)
- Auto-hiding of shoes with zero inventory count

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- Badge visualization for inventory counts isn't specified
- The detailed search functionality for the admin dashboard could be more explicit
- The automatic visibility control based on inventory isn't explicitly addressed

## 6. Pre-populated Settings

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Contains specific pre-populated values:
  - Project office address: 348 Cardona Cir, San Ramon, CA 94583, USA
  - Project manager's name: Walter Zhang
  - Project manager's email: walterzhang10@gmail.com
  - Project manager's phone: (916) 582-7090
  - Default shipping fee: $5

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- These specific default values aren't included in the development plan
- Need to ensure database seeding includes these initial values

## 7. Payment System Details

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Shipping fee is mentioned but the payment processing isn't detailed

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- Need to specify the payment gateway integration
- Need to address payment security considerations
- Payment receipt and confirmation workflow needs elaboration

## 8. Email Communications

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Multiple email confirmations mentioned:
  - After donation form submission
  - Upon successful checkout
  - Email verification during signup

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- While email confirmation is mentioned, a comprehensive email communication system isn't detailed
- Need to specify email template system
- Consider adding email delivery and tracking analytics

## 9. Shoe Quality Assessment

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Donation form includes condition assessment for shoes

**Gap in Development Plan:**
- The standardized quality/condition assessment system isn't detailed
- Need to establish condition categories and criteria

## 10. User Experience Details

**Project Description Specifics:**
- Success messages after form submissions
- Redirects after checkout
