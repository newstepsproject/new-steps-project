# New Steps Project - Comprehensive Development Plan

## Project Overview
The New Steps Project is a platform that facilitates the donation and redistribution of used sports shoes. People can donate shoes they no longer use, and others (particularly young athletes) can request these shoes for free, paying only for shipping if needed. This non-profit initiative aims to reduce waste, support young athletes, raise recycling awareness, and strengthen local communities.
